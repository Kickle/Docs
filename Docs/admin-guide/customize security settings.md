If you need to apply your own security policy settings or install your own management and security tools, you can log into Kickle as an administrator.

Start **Task Manager** from the “help menu” by pressing the **ctrl + tab** keys on the virtual keyboard. Then, select the **Users tab**, right-click on the Kickle user, and select **Disconnect**.

Login to Windows using the administrator account. Ask Kickle to retrieve the administrator account and the password <http://support.Kickle.com>. Now you can change the password.
Once logged in, you can configure your own security policy settings or install your own management and security tools.

!!! Warning " "
    Before modifying any security policy setting or installing any software, contact the Kickle support team <http://support.Kickle.com> to make sure there is no conflict.
