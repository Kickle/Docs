Kickle is able to manage attachments. If an user attach a file to invitation, it will be include automatically in the workspace.
By default, room mailbox deletes attachment. You can use this cmdlet to avoid suppression.

``` powershell
Set-CalendarProcessing â€“Identity KICKE01@mycompany.com -DeleteAttachments $false
```
