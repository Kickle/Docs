####Manage Attachments

Kickle is able to manage attachments. If a user attaches a file to an invitation, it will automatically be included in the workspace.
By default, room mailbox deletes attachment. You can use this cmdlet to avoid suppression.

``` powershell
Set-CalendarProcessing â€“Identity KICKE01@mycompany.com -DeleteAttachments $false
```
