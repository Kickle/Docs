## About Kickle

Kickle transforms any meeting room screen into a videoconferencing screen. If the screen is a touchscreen, it becomes interactive. Kickle includes a mini-PC, a high-definition video camera, and an omnidirectional tabletop microphone. Kickle fully supports and relies on Microsoft Skype for Business.
